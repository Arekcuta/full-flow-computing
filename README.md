## Overview

**Full Flow Computing** is a reversible computing architecture that prevents energy loss by recycling unused bit states directly into the power return loop. Instead of erasing inputs (which creates heat), the system returns them—intact and still charged—through the DC output line, preserving both information and energy.

This architecture is designed to operate like a closed water system: logic flows forward, unused charge flows back. No heat, no waste.

## Key Concepts

- Logic gates perform operations (e.g., `A AND B`) **without erasing** inputs
- Output logic continues as normal (`A AND B` to downstream logic)
- Original inputs (`A` and `B`) are sent to the **DC power return line**, not erased
- The power rail becomes a **bit-energy sink** that returns energy to the source
- This approach avoids entropy generation and supports **lossless computation**

---

## Why It Matters

- **Massive energy savings** (up to 90% theoretical reduction)
- No bit erasure → no Landauer heat loss
- Compatible with adiabatic logic, reversible gates, and future hardware
- Could be foundational for ultra-low power computing and cold-running processors
- Enables architectures that treat energy and logic as fully reusable

This concept was independently created by **Tucker Hansen**, in March 2025.

> “I haven’t done a full academic search on whether this exact model exists. If it has, I’d love to know. This is simply how I independently arrived at the concept.”

You are free to build upon it, improve it, test it, or use it for research. Please credit the original concept when doing so.
